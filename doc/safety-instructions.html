 Too often we read about the interesting features from a new
 software ("Do this, try that.") without being told about the
 "don't-s", the possible risks ("You didn't know that?").  This
 document tries to tell what not to do with _otg-disk_.

 I'm pretty sure there are more things to avoid but those below
 are the ones that come directly into my mind.  Let me know if
 you see more easy misconfigurations.


# Safety Instructions

_otg-disk_ was not made with security in mind (and the whole 
Raspberry setup is not) and it starts with the script itself.


### Script file permissions

The _otg-disk_ script contains password in clear-text, e.g. the
W-Lan or _samba_ share passwords.

This means that - as long you don't take extra care about the
script's read permissions - everyone who can access your Raspberry
can read the passwords too.  More generally speaking: _otg-disk_ is
made for Raspberries that have only you (or really trusted other
persons) as local user.

 - **Share you Raspberry (granting them local accounts) only with
   trusted others.**

Of course, this doesn't matter in situations where the passwords are
shared among a group of users anyway.


### Physical device security

Even if you have granted local accounts only to trusted persons (and
all use strong passwords etc.) this can be easily bypassed if one
gets physical access to the Raspberry.  All that is needed is
putting the SD-card into a card reader in another computer.


### Public file share

_otg-disk_ configures a public _samba_ file share that is read-write
open to all users that have access to the network (W-Lan or LAN).
No username/password is required (anonymous logins work) to connect
and the file server operates with the configured user's (most of the
time that is **your**) file permissions.  That is, the file server
grants happily access to your files, allowing other to read, modify
or delete them.

 - **Don't run the public file share if untrusted persons can connect
   to the network (wired or wireless).**

The public share itself can be turned off by unsetting either its
name or directory (i.e. assign empty values).  You might also
configure the option `PUBLIC_SHARE_OPT="read only = yes"` to deny
write access.


### Private file share

If a private file share is configured it is protected with a
password.  However, this protection is only as good as the
protection of the _otg-disk_ script file because it contains the
password in clear-text (`PRIVATE_SHARE_PASSWORD` variable).


### Other file shares

More file shares can be created from the `OTHER_SHARES` variable.
Access can be assigned to particular users and their _samba_ (!)
accounts can be created by adding the user's password to the
username in (again:) clear-text.

    OTHER_SHARES="media:/media:valid users = $USER, bob/7224x"

Would create a _samba_ account for user `bob` with the password
`7224x`.  However, to get access to the share the local system
(Raspberry) user `bob` must be created too but `bob` doesn't need to
be able to login to the Raspberry.  Here are two ways to prevent
users with a valid system account to login:

 - Don't assign a Linux password to _samba_-only users (and don't give
   them access to their `$HOME` directory because they can put an
   _ssh_-key there to get system access without a password.)

 - Assign _/bin/true_ as their login shell: `sudo useradd -s
   /bin/true -d /non-existant bob`.  Even better: use _otg-disk_'s
   `--create-share-account` operation.


### HTTP server

The HTTP server is configured for http only.  https (the encrypted
and safe version of http) would require to

 - get a server certificate from an official vendor (self-signed
   certs are not secure) with timely renewal,
 - that you enter the server's key password when the server boots,
   or enter it in plain-text in a file.

There is an alternative by setting up a local certificate authority
with [easy-rsa][1] but this is beyond _otg-disk_'s scope.

 - You should not transmit password or other confidential
   information using http if you are connected to an untrusted
   network or untrusted persons have access it.

The only really secure network connection would be on the USB
interface if you have on-the-go (OTG) network active.  This is as
secure as your OTG-host.


### Summary

To summarize what was said above, the important _don't-s_ are this:

 1. Protect your Raspberry against unauthorized physical access.

 2. Don't connect the _otg-disk_ Raspberry to an untrusted network
    or network where untrusted (or unknown) others can connect.

Notice that the Internet is just a very large untrusted network.  Do
not connect _otg-disk_ there unless you really understand what you
are doing.

Here are the _do-s_:

 1. Use it on your own and private network or in situations where you
    share / exchange files with known and trusted others.

 2. Update the Raspberry software often, e.g. use
    `./otg-disk --apt-system-update` for it.  Do this even if you
    connect the Raspberry only to trusted and controlled networks.
