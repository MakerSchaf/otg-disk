# otg-disk

_otg-disk_ is a combination of shell and _gawk_ scripts to run a kind
of ad-hoc _samba_ file-server.  Ok, a file-server?  How exciting can
that be?  First of all, _otg-disk_ implements some unusual features:

 - By default, a public password-free file share exists to allow
   easy file exchange on the network.  Think of a networked USB
   drive.  This has important security implications so make sure to
   read the [Safety Instructions][1].  Password protected shares are
   possible as well.

 - Optionally, _minidlnad_ can stream files (from the shares) to
   DLNA clients.

 - Deleting files (on a file share) controls the system.  E.g.,
   shutdown the Raspberry or start an additional service by deleting
   the respectve control file.  In other words: No _ssh_ or _vnc_
   access is required.

 - _otg-disk_ can run a local W-Lan hotspot on request or if there's
   no network connection available.  (For your next Lan party,
   workgroup meeting or simply when you run the Raspberry outside for
   an experiment.)

 - If _dwc2_ is enabled (in _/boot/config.txt_) _otg-disk_ can
   configure OTG network, e.g. to connect your Raspberry Zero (with
   no W-Lan chip).

Second, tries to avoid changes to the installed system wherever it can.

 - _otg-disk_ does not need to be installed.  Downloading the script
   is sufficient.  And since the script is a container for several
   _gawk_ scripts there is also nothing to unzip.  Additional
   software packages need to be installed but they are pretty
   common and available through standard package feeds.

 - No persistent configuration files.  _otg-disk_ is configured with
   shell variables in the script itself and this information is used
   to create e.g. a _smb.conf_ on-the-fly into a temporary
   directory.

 - Run as system service or not.  You can run the script ad-hoc
   (from the command line) when you need it or as a system service
   and _otg-disk_ de/installs itself.  Another optional file for
   system installation is for bash completion.  But again, you can
   activate that on demand.

So none of these functions require changes to the system.  Everything
is configured in the _otg-disk_ script.  If concurring services are
already running (e.g. a regular _samba_ server) they are terminated
when _otg-disk_ starts and restarted when it ends.  The thing is
really to have the server ad-hoc, when it is needed - only.


### Documentation

 : [Safety Instructions][1]
  _otg-disk_ makes it simple to run a file-server with or without
  password protection.  I hope / think the script lowers the bar to
  run and operate a server significantly.  Even unexperienced users
  should be able to install and use the script.  However, the less
  you know about computers, servers and security the less you know
  about possible pitfalls and the more you want to read the safety
  instructions, which list some "do not to this".

 : [Installing _otg-disk_][2]
  This documents guides you through the installation of additional
  software packages (_otg-disk_ itself needs no installation).  All of
  them are pretty standard and you might have them already on your
  system.  Ways to configure _otg-disk_ are also here.

 : [Easy Mode][8]
  The document explains what _otg-disk_ can do without further tweaks
  just by adjusting its configuration: running the "networked USB
  drive", stream to DLNA clients and start a local W-Lan hotspot.
  There's no scripting required, only configuration, either by editing
  variables in the script or running the `--configure` command, see
  [Installing _otg-disk_][2].

 : [HTTP Interface][3]
  _otg-disk_ uses _busybox_ to run a simple HTTP server.  This
  document describes two CGI scripts you might want to add to
  _otg-disk_.  The first script implements file uploads by HTTP to
  an arbitrary space of your server and the second implements a very
  simple way to start operations by HTTP.  (Think of running the
  Raspberry off-site with its own W-Lan an no computer but only your
  mobile around.)  This part requires download additional files into
  the HTTP server's _cgi-bin_ directory and adjusting the scripts
  for configuration.

 : [USB Disks][4]
  _otg-disk_ can work with USB disks.  In contrast to the things
  before, this needs some shell scripting and the requirements are
  explained in this document.

 : [Reference][5]
  Finally, there's the reference document describing configuration
  options, _otg-disk_ commands and the command line user interface.


### Downloads

 : [_otg-disk_][6]
  The script itself.

 : [_switch-dwc2_][7]
  A helper script to de/activate the _dwc2_ overlay for OTG network
  in _/boot/config.txt_ from the command line.  This script can be
  useful when working with USB devices.
