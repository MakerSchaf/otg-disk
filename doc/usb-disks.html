 _otg-disk_ can monitor USB disks as they are connected to the
 Raspberry, mount them automatically and offer available operations
 through the _samba_ server's system control directory.  But all of
 this needs to be scripted.  This document explains how it works.


# USB Disks

### Preparation

Before you start with USB disks (or other devices) you must
understand that USB usage and on-the-go networking (or other OTG
functions) are mutually exclusive: you really can't have them both
at the same time.  OTG is activated by

 1. Loading the _dwc2_ overlay (`dtoverlay=dwc2`) in
    _/boot/config.txt_, and
 2. loading the kernel modules *g_ether* or *g_multi* during of after
    system boot.

Depending on your USB setup, USB may work with _dwc2_ enabled or not
but you should disable _dwc2_ to be on the safe side.  (My personal
experience: if _dwc2_ is loaded then devices connected to the
Raspberry's (Zero) USB port don't work anymore.  Connecting them via
an external USB hub may work or not.)  If you want to try USB with
_dwc2_

 - connect a USB hub to the Raspberry,
 - boot the device, and
 - check _otg-disk_'s logfile (`./otg-disk --tail`): if it says
   `starting USB monitor` then _otg-disk_ is ready for USB devices.
 - The final test is to connect a USB disk.  If USB is working (and
   not impacted by _dwc2_) _otg-disk_ writes a line like
   `usb-monitor: detected sda sda1 2616-554A` (the last
   parameter is the UUID as reported by _lsblk_) into its log.

If necessary you can edit _/boot/config.txt_ but there's also the
script [_switch-dwc2_][1] doing that for you.

    $ ./switch-dwc2 --status

displays the current status.  If its `on` it must be turned `off`:

    $ ./switch-dwc2 off

Notice that _switch-dwc2_ silently goes to superuser mode when
editing the file.  An extra _sudo_ is not required.  If you place the
script in _otg-disk_'s directory you'll also find the appropriate
on/off-action in the system control directory.

Don't forget to reboot to de/activate the overlay after changing
_config.txt_.


### Scripting

_otg-disk_ expects scripts to be around to implement any kind of
interactions you want to have and does also not automatically mount
disks that are connected.  When it find disks (better: partitions)
connected to USB, _otg-disk_ checks first if the file ``usb.*uuid*``
exists, where _UUID_ is the partition's UUID identifier as reported
by `lsblk --raw --output NAME,MAJ:MIN,UUID`.

So the first thing to do for a new disk is to pick the UUID(s) from
_otg-disk_'s logfile (`./otg-disk --tail`).  They are reported in
_usb-monitor_'s notifications:

    usb-monitor: detected sda sda2 ACB5-7A23

The last value is the _/dev/sda2_'s UUID.

If the required file exists in _otg-disk_'s directory and is
executable

 1. the partition is mounted on ``/media/$USER/_uuid_``, and
 2. the script is run with **--mount** as first and the UUID as
    second command line argument.

The script can then do whatever might need to be done when the disk
is mounted.

After that _otg-disk_ queries the available operations by reading
the output from ``_script_ --op _uuid_``.  An action file is created
in `$SYSTRCL` for each output word.  If the **--op** operation
returns a non-zero exit code the partition is immediately unmounted.
The partition remains online until the umount file is deleted.  In
that case ``_script_ --umount _uuid_`` is executed and the disk is
unmounted.  In between any implemented operation can be triggered by
deleting the respective action file in `$SYSCTRL`.


### Examples

The following script demonstrates the scheme.

```
    #!/bin/sh
    #
    
    NAME=$(basename $0)
    UUID=${NAME#usb.}
    MNT="/media/$USER/$UUID"
    
    bin=$(dirname $0)
    
    case "$1" in
        --mount)
            "$bin/beep"
            ;;
    
        --umount)
            ;;
    
        --op)
            echo test backup
            ;;
    
        test)
            echo "$NAME: test operation" &2
            ;;
    
        backup)
            echo "$NAME: backup operation" &2
            sleep 2
            "$bin/beep" 2
            ;;
    
        *)
            echo $NAME: operation not implemented: "$1" &2
            exit 1
            ;;
    esac
    exit 0
```

It makes a sound (asssuming script and hardware is available) when
the partition is mounted, implements two actions (test and backup)
and makes two beeps after the simulated backup operation has
finished.

The following script implements an automatic backup on mount.

```
    #!/bin/sh
    #
    
    
    NAME=$(basename $0)
    UUID=${NAME#usb.}
    MNT="/media/$USER/$UUID"
    
    bin=$(dirname $0)
    
    case "$1" in
        --mount)
            # Automatically create a backup.
            "$bin/beep"
            sh /media/pi/0C39-72F7/moba/bin/moba.sh create
            "$bin/beep" 2
            ;;
    
        --umount)
            # "$bin/beep"
            ;;
    
        --op)
            # An exit code != 0 makes otg-disk unmount us.
            exit 1
            ;;
    
        *)
            echo $NAME: operation not implemented: "$1" &2
            exit 1
            ;;
    esac
    exit 0
```

The script issues a beep to signal that the partition is mounted and
the following backup script _moba.sh_ started (don't unplug the
device).  There are two more beeps when the script finished (unplug
now) and since **--op** returns a non-zero exit code the partition
is unmounted.  (Any **--umount** action would be triggered too, so
it would also be possible to move the double beep there.)


### Commands for USB mounts

_otg-disk_ implements two commands for USB mounts:

 : **--mount** :
  List UUID and mount point of partitions, which are mounted below
  _/media/$USER_.

 : **--umount** _uuid_ :
  Unmount the partition _uuid_ if it is mounted below _/media/$USER_.

Notice, that the partitions on which _otg-disk_ can works, were not
necessarily mounted by _otg-disk_.  They are just in the right
location.  E.g., Linux file-managers may use the same location.
