<PRE CLASS="code"># Name and path of public samba share.
PUBLIC_SHARE_NAME="pub"
PUBLIC_SHARE_PATH="/home/$USER/tmp"

</UL>
<P>The <CODE>SYSCTRL</CODE> directory contains the files to control the Raspberry

<P>Now having everything public may not be what you want and there are
options to configure a password protected share to be accessible by

PRIVATE_SHARE_USERNAME="$USER"
PRIVATE_SHARE_PASSWORD="PutYourPasswordHere"

<P>The variables work as for the public share but you have to specify
a password.  The private share is configured by <EM>otg-disk</EM> if its
name and path is set.</P>
<P>There is also the <CODE>OTHER_SHARES</CODE> option which allows you to
configure even more shares but this is beyond this introduction.
See the <A HREF="reference.html" TITLE="otg-disk reference">reference document</A> for more information about it.</P>
<P>Restart <EM>otg-disk</EM> to activate any modification.</P>
<H3><P>Running a DLNA server</P></H3>
<P>There are a lot of Raspberry on-the-go projects and one is this: A
Pi Zero emulates a USB-disk to a smart TV and gets file updates by
its wireless network see <A HREF="https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/articles/pi-zero-w-smart-usb-flash-drive" TARGET="_blank" TITLE=" &quot;Make a Pi Zero W Smart USB flash drive&quot;">Make a Pi Zero W Smart USB flash
drive</A>.  Today's smart TV come usually with DLNA software and
<EM>otg-disk</EM> comes with builtin support for that.  So we can use DLNA
instead, if we install and configure it.</P>
<P>Run <CODE>./otg-disk --apt-check minidlna</CODE> to see if the server is
already installed or not and run</P>
<PRE CLASS="code">$ sudo ./otg-disk --apt-get minidlna - minidlna</PRE>
<P>if not.  This installs and disables the service.</P>
<P>The configuration is again done in the script file.</P>
<PRE CLASS="code"># The SYS directory gives control to these services.

<PRE CLASS="code"># Set this path to start minidlna.

...
# Systems services to check for stopping / restarting.
SYSTEM_SERVICES="minidlnad"</PRE>
<P>The options above tell <EM>otg-disk</EM></P>
<UL>
<LI>to provide service control files for the DLNA server:
 <CODE>SERVICE_LIST="vnc httpd minidlna"</CODE> (and for <EM>vnc</EM> and <EM>httpd</EM>
 too),</LI>
<LI>to start the DLNA service automatically:
 <CODE>START_SERVICES="minidlna"</CODE>,</LI>
<LI>that the media files (music, pictures, videos) are in the
 public file share: <CODE>MEDIA_PATH="$PUBLIC_SHARE_PATH"</CODE>,</LI>
<LI>and that <EM>otg-disk</EM> should check for an already running service
 instance and stop it on startup (just it case <EM>minidlnad</EM> is one
 of your normal system services): <CODE>SYSTEM_SERVICES="minidlnad"</CODE>.</LI>
</UL>
<P>From the options above, <CODE>MEDIA_PATH</CODE> must be set.  Otherwise
<EM>minidlnad</EM> is not started.  It the directory doesn't exist it is
created.  The service will also not run, if <EM>otg-disk</EM> detects that
an instance of it is already running.</P>
<P>With the configuration above the Raspberry can now also share media
files to smart TVs, get updated or additional media files by W-Lan
(or cable network) and serve multiple clients at the same time,
which is somewhat more (a considerable upgrade) than the OTG project
mentioned above.</P>
<H3><P>Access point configuration</P></H3>
<P>Another interesting thing is that <EM>otg-disk</EM> can start a W-Lan
hotspot allowing clients to connect without an additional W-Lan
access point.  (Think of your next LAN party or workgroup meeting
but make sure you operate the Raspberry in a trusted environment and
network.)</P>
<P>First, we may need to install two more packages:</P>
<PRE CLASS="code">$ ./otg-disk --apt-check hostapd dnsmasq</PRE>
<P>and install missing packages with e.g.</P>
<PRE CLASS="code">$ sudo ./otg-disk --apt-get hostapd dnsmasq - hostapd dnsmasq</PRE>
<P>assuming that you need to get both.  There are two parts to
configure: first the wireless network and then its IP configuration.</P>
<PRE CLASS="code"># Hotspot configuration.
WLAN_COUNTRY_CODE="XX"
WLAN_SSID="$(hostname)-ap"
WLAN_PASSWD="AnotherSecretPassword"</PRE>
<P>Make sure to set the correct country code for your location (e.g.
<CODE>DE</CODE> for Germany, see <EM>/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</EM>)
otherwise your hotspot may be illegal (and not properly working).
Set SSID and password as you like.</P>
<P>The default IP-configuration is this:</P>
<PRE CLASS="code"># Access point network.
AP_IFC="wlan0"
AP_IP_ADDR="192.168.1.1"
AP_NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
AP_DHCP_DEF="192.168.1.11,192.168.1.55,255.255.255.0,24h"</PRE>
<P>These four parameters configure the hotspot network (192.168.1.1/24)
and <EM>dnsmasq</EM>'s DHCP server (DHCP range is from 192.168.1.11 to
192.168.1.55). <CODE>AP_IFC</CODE> needs to be changed if you have multiple
W-Lan adapters and the hotspot shall not run on wlan0.</P>
<P>Of course, when you boot the Raspberry outside your home network you
cannot connect to it (by wireless) to start the hotspot and there are
two work-arounds:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Connect you laptop on USB on-the-go network to start the
 hotspot, or</LI>
<LI>tell <EM>otg-disk</EM> to automatically start the hotspot if it doesn't
 find a working network connection.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Option 2 is configured inside the script below the IP configuration.</P>
<PRE CLASS="code"># The script can check on startup if any network is available
# and start the configured access point if not.
AP_AUTOSTART=yes</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="code"># Wait that much seconds before testing for networks.
AP_AUTOSTART_DELAY=30</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="code"># If the access point is started, the busybox http server
# can be started too.
AP_AUTOSTART_HTTP=no</PRE>
<P>If <CODE>AP_AUTOSTART=yes</CODE> is set <EM>otg-disk</EM> waits <CODE>$AP_AUTOSTART_DELAY</CODE>
seconds (here: 30 seconds) after startup to allow working network
connections to come up.  If it doesn't find any (wireless, cable
or on-the-go ethernet) it starts the configured access point.  It
can also start the builtin HTTP server assuming that it is on an
outdoor location and controlled from a mobile (no laptop with
file explorer around) but this is beyond this document but we will
come back to that later.</P>
<H3><P>HTTP server</P></H3>
<P><EM>otg-disk</EM> comes with support for a simple HTTP server.  It uses the
<EM>busybox</EM> http module, which means that no further software needs to
be installed.  There are only two configuration options:</P>
<PRE CLASS="code"># Parameters for busybox httpd.
HTTP_PORT=2080
HTTP_DOCUMENT_ROOT="$PUBLIC_SHARE_PATH"</PRE>
<P>The HTTP server's service port is 2080 (<EM>otg-disk</EM> does not support
running the server on an unprivileged port &lt; 1024) and the webspace
is (in the default configuration) equal to your public file share.</P>
<P>So far, the HTTP server is only of limited use.  It allows a client
without a <EM>samba</EM> (or cifs) client (e.g. a mobile phone) to access
files on the Raspberry.  But HTTP and CGI scripting adds a whole new
world of possible application, which are beyond this document.</P>
<H3><P>On-the-go network configuration</P></H3>
<P>I started with <EM>otg-disk</EM> to easily connect to Pi Zeros that don't
have the wireless chip.  On-the-go network is the only working thing
here.  It's also useful when the Raspberry has a W-LAN chips but
your host can (or should) not connect to it.  In that case USB gives
you a working network connection.  It does however require a change
of your Gadget's system configuration: you have to activate the <EM>dwc2</EM>
overlay at boot time.</P>
<P>Before you do this, you should know that loading <EM>dwc2</EM> impacts USB
handling.</P>
<UL>
<LI>With <EM>dwc2</EM> loaded, connecting devices to the Raspi's own USB
 controller stops working.</LI>
<LI>If you connect USB devices via another USB hub it may work or
 not.</LI>
<LI>If <EM>dwc2</EM> is loaded and USB networking (by loading <EM>g_ether</EM> or
 <EM>libcomposite</EM>) is activated, all local USB devices stop working
 and are in fact connected to the computer hosting the Raspberry.</LI>
</UL>
<P>To enable on-the-go network add the line <CODE>dtoverlay=dwc2</CODE> in an
<CODE>[all]</CODE> section</P>
<PRE CLASS="code">[all]
dtoverlay=dwc2</PRE>
<P>in the file <EM>/boot/config.txt</EM> (if <EM>dwc2</EM> isn't already there) and
reboot the Raspberry.  You can also download the script
<A HREF="switch-dwc2" TARGET="_blank" TITLE="switch-dc2"><EM>switch-dwc2</EM></A>, which lets you enable and disable the overlay
from the command line.</P>
<P>In addition to the <EM>dwc2</EM> overlay the kernel module <EM>libcomposite</EM>
must be loaded to activate the network.  <EM>otg-disk</EM> will do this if</P>
<OL>
<LI>the USB network adapter's MAC address is set with the
 <CODE>OTG_DEV_ADDR</CODE> option,</LI>
<LI>the <EM>dwc2</EM> overlay is activated,</LI>
<LI>neither <EM>g_ether</EM> nor <EM>g_multi</EM> are already loaded, and</LI>
<LI>only one device (the Raspberry's own USB hub) is found on the
 USB.</LI>
</OL>
<P>These conditions shall ensure that OTG does not interfere with a
connected USB device, which you want to access.  Additionally the
required configuration option</P>
<PRE CLASS="code"># MAC address in case g_ether is loaded here.
OTG_DEV_ADDR="aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:f1"</PRE>
<P>makes the Raspi always pick the same IP address, which makes life
somewhat easier.</P>
<P>For Raspbian Bookwork the method of network configuration changed to
<EM>NetworkManager</EM>.  Using that takes comparable long (and comes in
addition to the "slow" boot time) to go through DHCP and local-link
(aka zeroconf).  Therefore it is recommended to configure a fixexd
IP-number, which is used when set:</P>
<PRE CLASS="code"># Use this fixed IP address instead of nmcli zeroconf or other.
OTG_IP_ADDR="169.254.233.90"</PRE>
<P>No network mask is expected or supported (which is 255.255.0.0 for
zeroconf).  If the network does not come up check the network settings
of your host.  You might have to activate zeroconf/locallink here too.</P>
<P>The network still fails you can access the Raspberry on the USB's
serial interface.  If your host is Linux the command would be</P>
<PRE CLASS="code">minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0</PRE>
<P>Notice also that you need special OTG cables or adapters to connect
the Raspi to a capable host.  Not all cables will work.  Usually a
smartphone cable that can be used to exchange data with a computer
should do.</P>
<H3 ID="systemd-service"><P>Running otg-disk</P></H3>
<P>When you have followed the introduction you have started <EM>otg-disk</EM>
already several times from the command line.</P>
<PRE CLASS="code">$ ./otg-disk --start</PRE>

server provides a simple way to exchange files between clients.  Today's
popular operating systems (iOS, Linux, Windows, UNIX) have built-in

<P>The DLNA server streams media files to clients.  Again, support

<!-- source: text/markdown

_otg-disk_ provides some functionality which needs to be configured,
activated and deactivated by changing configuration parameters.  No
scripting or system configuration is needed.  I call this the _easy
mode_ where a user does not need to dive deep into the system and
its configuration.  Easy mode delivers

 - simple public and/or private _samba_/cifs file shares,
 - streaming content by DLNA,
 - serving content by HTTP, and
 - running also an optional W-Lan hotspot.

which turns the Raspberry into an on-demand "networked USB drive".



### File server operation

With this installation and _otg-disk_'s default configuration you can

 - run an unprotected file server to allow easy file sharing between
   computers,
 - shutdown (or reboot) the Raspberry by deleting files on the _samba_
   share (no _ssh_ or similar required).

Simply run

    $ ./otg-disk --start
    runnnig otg-disk, press CTRL+C to terminate.
    Starting smbd ...
    Starting sys-monitor ...
    Setting up watches.  Beware: since -r was given, this may take a while!
    Watches established.

If your output looks different then something is wrong.

Now open a file explorer and connect to _otg-disk_'s file server.
For Linux the address should be ``smb://_name-of-your-raspberry_/``
and ``//_name-of-your-raspberry_/`` for Windows.  You may also find
the Raspberry in the network neighborhood.  However you connect, you
should see the `pub` share.  Open it and connect anonymously when
asked for login information.  No password is needed.

The share contains the files from your _tmp_ directory (full path:
_~/tmp_ or $HOME_/tmp_).  If you don't have that directory is is
created by _otg-disk_.  You can copy files to or from there, create
and delete directories and files as you like.  The file server
behaves like a simple "networked USB drive", granting access to
everything.


### Device operation

The file share contains also a directory named _sys_.  This is
special and creates _otg-disk_'s second core function: system
operation by file manipulation.  The directory is pre-populated with
files like _shutdown_ or _vnc.start_.  Deleting one of the files
triggers the corresponding action, i.e. deleting _shutdown_ shuts
the Raspberry down and deleting _vnc.start_ starts a VNC server.
You will also get the file _vnc.stop_ in exchange.

Assuming you would install _otg-disk_ as system service you could

 - power on then device on demand,
 - exchange files as you need,
 - and power it off again

by only accessing the file server.  None of the usual remote access
tools like _ssh_ or _vnc_ would be required.


### File server configuration

All of _otg-disk_'s configuration is inside the script.  To modify
it you have to open the script in a text editor.  Look for the line
`# Configuration.`.  The parameters are set below and so far the
following settings were used.

    # Name and path of public samba share.
    PUBLIC_SHARE_NAME="pub"
    PUBLIC_SHARE_PATH="/home/$USER/tmp"
    PUBLIC_SHARE_OPT="read only = no"
    ...
    # This is the location of the control directory.
    SYSCTRL="$PUBLIC_SHARE_PATH/sys"

The lines are not consecutive (indicated be the three dots `...`).
As you might have guessed, these assignments configure

 - the public share's name: `PUBLIC_SHARE_NAME="pub"`,
 - its directory: `PUBLIC_SHARE_PATH="/home/$USER/tmp"`,
 - and makes it writeable (which is also the default):
   `PUBLIC_SHARE_OPT="read only = no"`.

The `SYSCTRL` directory contains the files to control the Raspberry
and must be accessible inside the file server.

Now having everything public may not be what you want and there are
options to configure a password protected share to be accessible by
only you:

    # Configuration of password protected share.
    PRIVATE_SHARE_NAME=""
    PRIVATE_SHARE_PATH="$HOME"
    PRIVATE_SHARE_USERNAME="$USER"
    PRIVATE_SHARE_PASSWORD="PutYourPasswordHere"
    PRIVATE_SHARE_OPT=""

The variables work as for the public share but you have to specify
a password.  The private share is configured by _otg-disk_ if its
name and path is set.

There is also the `OTHER_SHARES` option which allows you to
configure even more shares but this is beyond this introduction.
See the [reference document][1] for more information about it.

Restart _otg-disk_ to activate any modification.


### Running a DLNA server

There are a lot of Raspberry on-the-go projects and one is this: A
Pi Zero emulates a USB-disk to a smart TV and gets file updates by
its wireless network see [Make a Pi Zero W Smart USB flash
drive][2].  Today's smart TV come usually with DLNA software and
_otg-disk_ comes with builtin support for that.  So we can use DLNA
instead, if we install and configure it.

Run `./otg-disk --apt-check minidlna` to see if the server is
already installed or not and run

    $ sudo ./otg-disk --apt-get minidlna - minidlna

if not.  This installs and disables the service.

The configuration is again done in the script file.

    # The SYS directory gives control to these services.
    SERVICE_LIST="vnc httpd minidlna"
    
    # Start these services with otg-disk.
    START_SERVICES="minidlna"

    # Set this path to start minidlna.
    MEDIA_PATH="$PUBLIC_SHARE_PATH"
    ...
    # Systems services to check for stopping / restarting.
    SYSTEM_SERVICES="minidlnad"

The options above tell _otg-disk_

 - to provide service control files for the DLNA server:
   `SERVICE_LIST="vnc httpd minidlna"` (and for _vnc_ and _httpd_
   too),
 - to start the DLNA service automatically:
   `START_SERVICES="minidlna"`,
 - that the media files (music, pictures, videos) are in the
   public file share: `MEDIA_PATH="$PUBLIC_SHARE_PATH"`,
 - and that _otg-disk_ should check for an already running service
   instance and stop it on startup (just it case _minidlnad_ is one
   of your normal system services): `SYSTEM_SERVICES="minidlnad"`.

From the options above, `MEDIA_PATH` must be set.  Otherwise
_minidlnad_ is not started.  It the directory doesn't exist it is
created.  The service will also not run, if _otg-disk_ detects that
an instance of it is already running.

With the configuration above the Raspberry can now also share media
files to smart TVs, get updated or additional media files by W-Lan
(or cable network) and serve multiple clients at the same time,
which is somewhat more (a considerable upgrade) than the OTG project
mentioned above.


### Access point configuration

Another interesting thing is that _otg-disk_ can start a W-Lan
hotspot allowing clients to connect without an additional W-Lan
access point.  (Think of your next LAN party or workgroup meeting
but make sure you operate the Raspberry in a trusted environment and
network.)

First, we may need to install two more packages:

    $ ./otg-disk --apt-check hostapd dnsmasq

and install missing packages with e.g.

    $ sudo ./otg-disk --apt-get hostapd dnsmasq - hostapd dnsmasq

assuming that you need to get both.  There are two parts to
configure: first the wireless network and then its IP configuration.

    # Hotspot configuration.
    WLAN_COUNTRY_CODE="XX"
    WLAN_SSID="$(hostname)-ap"
    WLAN_PASSWD="AnotherSecretPassword"

Make sure to set the correct country code for your location (e.g.
`DE` for Germany, see _/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf_)
otherwise your hotspot may be illegal (and not properly working).
Set SSID and password as you like.

The default IP-configuration is this:

    # Access point network.
    AP_IFC="wlan0"
    AP_IP_ADDR="192.168.1.1"
    AP_NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
    AP_DHCP_DEF="192.168.1.11,192.168.1.55,255.255.255.0,24h"

These four parameters configure the hotspot network (192.168.1.1/24)
and _dnsmasq_'s DHCP server (DHCP range is from 192.168.1.11 to
192.168.1.55). `AP_IFC` needs to be changed if you have multiple
W-Lan adapters and the hotspot shall not run on wlan0.

Of course, when you boot the Raspberry outside your home network you
cannot connect to it (by wireless) to start the hotspot and there are
two work-arounds:

 1. Connect you laptop on USB on-the-go network to start the
    hotspot, or
 2. tell _otg-disk_ to automatically start the hotspot if it doesn't
    find a working network connection.

Option 2 is configured inside the script below the IP configuration.

    # The script can check on startup if any network is available
    # and start the configured access point if not.
    AP_AUTOSTART=yes
    
    # Wait that much seconds before testing for networks.
    AP_AUTOSTART_DELAY=30
    
    # If the access point is started, the busybox http server
    # can be started too.
    AP_AUTOSTART_HTTP=no

If `AP_AUTOSTART=yes` is set _otg-disk_ waits `$AP_AUTOSTART_DELAY`
seconds (here: 30 seconds) after startup to allow working network
connections to come up.  If it doesn't find any (wireless, cable
or on-the-go ethernet) it starts the configured access point.  It
can also start the builtin HTTP server assuming that it is on an
outdoor location and controlled from a mobile (no laptop with
file explorer around) but this is beyond this document but we will
come back to that later.


### HTTP server

_otg-disk_ comes with support for a simple HTTP server.  It uses the
_busybox_ http module, which means that no further software needs to
be installed.  There are only two configuration options:

    # Parameters for busybox httpd.
    HTTP_PORT=2080
    HTTP_DOCUMENT_ROOT="$PUBLIC_SHARE_PATH"

The HTTP server's service port is 2080 (_otg-disk_ does not support
running the server on an unprivileged port < 1024) and the webspace
is (in the default configuration) equal to your public file share.

So far, the HTTP server is only of limited use.  It allows a client
without a _samba_ (or cifs) client (e.g. a mobile phone) to access
files on the Raspberry.  But HTTP and CGI scripting adds a whole new
world of possible application, which are beyond this document.


### On-the-go network configuration

I started with _otg-disk_ to easily connect to Pi Zeros that don't
have the wireless chip.  On-the-go network is the only working thing
here.  It's also useful when the Raspberry has a W-LAN chips but
your host can (or should) not connect to it.  In that case USB gives
you a working network connection.  It does however require a change
of your Gadget's system configuration: you have to activate the _dwc2_
overlay at boot time.

Before you do this, you should know that loading _dwc2_ impacts USB
handling.

 - With _dwc2_ loaded, connecting devices to the Raspi's own USB
   controller stops working.
 - If you connect USB devices via another USB hub it may work or
   not.
 - If _dwc2_ is loaded and USB networking (by loading *g_ether* or
   *libcomposite*) is activated, all local USB devices stop working
   and are in fact connected to the computer hosting the Raspberry.

To enable on-the-go network add the line `dtoverlay=dwc2` in an
`[all]` section

    [all]
    dtoverlay=dwc2

in the file _/boot/config.txt_ (if _dwc2_ isn't already there) and
reboot the Raspberry.  You can also download the script
[_switch-dwc2_][3], which lets you enable and disable the overlay
from the command line.

In addition to the _dwc2_ overlay the kernel module *libcomposite*
must be loaded to activate the network.  _otg-disk_ will do this if

 1. the USB network adapter's MAC address is set with the
    `OTG_DEV_ADDR` option,
 2. the _dwc2_ overlay is activated,
 3. neither *g_ether* nor *g_multi* are already loaded, and
 4. only one device (the Raspberry's own USB hub) is found on the
    USB.

These conditions shall ensure that OTG does not interfere with a
connected USB device, which you want to access.  Additionally the
required configuration option

    # MAC address in case g_ether is loaded here.
    OTG_DEV_ADDR="aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:f1"

makes the Raspi always pick the same IP address, which makes life
somewhat easier.

For Raspbian Bookwork the method of network configuration changed to
*NetworkManager*.  Using that takes comparable long (and comes in
addition to the "slow" boot time) to go through DHCP and local-link
(aka zeroconf).  Therefore it is recommended to configure a fixexd
IP-number, which is used when set:

    # Use this fixed IP address instead of nmcli zeroconf or other.
    OTG_IP_ADDR="169.254.233.90"

No network mask is expected or supported (which is 255.255.0.0 for
zeroconf).  If the network does not come up check the network settings
of your host.  You might have to activate zeroconf/locallink here too.

The network still fails you can access the Raspberry on the USB's
serial interface.  If your host is Linux the command would be

    minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Notice also that you need special OTG cables or adapters to connect
the Raspi to a capable host.  Not all cables will work.  Usually a
smartphone cable that can be used to exchange data with a computer
should do.


### Running otg-disk  { #systemd-service }

When you have followed the introduction you have started _otg-disk_
already several times from the command line.

    $ ./otg-disk --start

This is ideal for ad-hoc services or when you want to debug things
because log messages go to the console when the script is started
from a terminal.  Pressing `Ctrl+C` stops the script.

You may want to run _otg-disk_ as a system service and this is easy
to do.  However you should check if (and where) the script writes
its logfiles:

    # Logs are stored here.
    LOGDIR="$PUBLIC_SHARE_PATH/logs"

If `LOGDIR` is set _otg-disk_'s log messages are written to this
directory, one file per invocation.  Logfiles accumulate in the
directory and you should remove old files from time to time.  If you
unset the `LOGDIR` option log messages go to the system's log file
(usually _/var/log/messages_).

To install _otg-disk_ as a system service you need to run only

    $ sudo ./otg-disk --install

This creates a _systemd_ unit file in _/etc/systemd/system_ and
registers it but the service is not immediately started.  Run

    $ sudo systemctl start otg-disk.service

for that (or reboot).

After that

 - _otg-disk_ will be started on every boot,
 - starting the file server and all other services, which are
   configured to automatically start (`START_SERVICES` option).

If you want to debug the / edit the script stop the system service
first and run _otg-disk_ manually:

    $ sudo systemctl stop otg-disk.service
    $ ./otg-disk --start

Uninstalling the _otg-disk_ as simple as installing:

    $ sudo ./otg-disk --uninstall

stops the service, removes the unit files and reloads _systemd_'s
configuration.


There's also an alternative installation option.  If you use

    $ sudo ./otg-disk --install-otg

(instead of the `--install` from above) then the script checks first
if _usb0_ is up and continues to start only if that's the case.


### Accessing the server

The configuration enables two server components on the Raspberry: a
_samba_ and (if activated) a DLNA server.  (The HTTP server needs
some more work, which is done in [the next document][4]).  The _samba_
server provides a simple way to exchange files between clients.  Today's
popular operating systems (iOS, Linux, Windows, UNIX) have built-in
support for the protocol.  Even some mobile phones have it
out-of-the-box and smb/cifs compatible software is available in the app
stores.

The DLNA server streams media files to clients.  Again, support
comes with the major operating system and mobiles phones but smart TVs
are possible options.  Finally, there's the local W-Lan hotspot.  It
allows some flexibility with the "where" because it enables the
Raspberry to create its network infrastructure for the running services.
