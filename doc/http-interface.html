 _otg-disk_ can run an HTTP server.  This document describes two
 possible applications, which support using the _otg-disk_ Raspberry
 with mobile phones: file uploads and system control.  (Both scripts
 can be used without _otg-disk_).


# HTTP Interface

Before you start important things with the HTTP server, understand
that _otg-disk_ HTTP server uses only plain HTTP.  That is, all data
is transmitted in clear-text and open to anyone else who is on the
same network.  When running the server on an untrusted network you
need to

 - either switch to https,
 - or limit access to the Raspberry's USB (on-the-go aka OTG) network

to secure your data.


### Script Handler

[_script-handler.cgi_][1] reads definitions for HTML input forms from
script files (shell, _python_, _gawk_, ...).  When the form is
submitted, the script is executed the input data is exported as shell
environment variables, the script is is executed and the script's
output is sent to the client.

_script-handler.cgi_ has its own [documentation][2].  See there for more
information.  Here is a simple example.

```
    #!/bin/sh
    #
    
    #
    # :title Shutdown
    # :name System ausschalten oder booten
    #
    # :label reboot Operation:
    # :radio reboot --checked shutdown Shutdown
    # :radio reboot reboot Reboot computer
    #
    
    M=-h
    if [ "$reboot" = "reboot" ]; then
        M=-r
        echo rebooting ...
    else
        echo shutting down ...
    fi
    
    sudo shutdown $M now
    echo ok.
```

The script reboots or shuts down the Raspberry and
_script-handler.cgi_ creates the input form to collect the parameter.
The script can be in any scripting language and the only requirement
is that it supports `#`-sytle comments because _script-handler.cgi_
scans them to get the form definitions.  If you really need to start a
non-script create a wrapping shell script.


### File Receiver

[_file-receiver.cgi_][3] is the other script that might be useful.  It
allows users to upload files with POST requests to an area of the web
server.  It is used by opening its URL, e.g.

    http://raspberry:2080/cgi-bin/file-receiver.cgi

The location where the script stores the files is configured inside
the script with the `_base_address` variable.  It must be appended to
the URL when uploading data but _file-receiver.cgi_ adds it for GET
requests.

The CGI script lists the files in the accessed directory and a simple
form to upload files is added to the end of if.  Pressing the "Choose
Files" button lets the user pick files from his computer, which are
stored in the directory when submitted.


### Using the scripts

The CGI scripts can be used with any web client.  They are however made
for mobile phones.  I found [HTTP Request Shortcuts][4] in Google's
Android app store.  It is a handy tool to send preconfigured HTTP
requests to a server.  E.g.

 - a POST request,
 - to a suitable URL, e.g. _/cgi-bin/file-receiver.cgi/uploads/_,
 - with the request body type being form-data, and
 - a file input parameter

creates a "Send to" receiver on the mobile, which can send multiple
files to the configured location in a single request.  That's an easy
way to put files on a server without using a cloud service.
