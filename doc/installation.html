# Installation

There is one pre-requisite you need before you start with the
following: you need to have _gawk_ installed.

    $ sudo apt-get update  &&  sudo apt-get install gawk

Having _gawk_ is so normal for me that I didn't think of it when
writing the documentation.


### Installing otg-disk

_otg-disk_ itself does not need to be installed in a specific way.
You can store it anywhere on your disk and run it from there and if
there's something particular about the storage location then it is
that it should _not_ be installed in a system directory like _/bin_
etc.  This document assumes that you have the script stored
in the current directory, which can by in or anywhere below your
$HOME.


### Command line interface

_otg-disk_ integrates all operations it needs and they are chosen with
the first command line parameter.  `otg-disk --help` lists them with a
very short explanation.  All operations start with two dashes `--`
with `--help` as the only exception: `otg-disk help` displays
_otg-disk_'s command information too.  Running _otg-disk_ without a
parameter prints an error message.

Operation names can not be abbreviated and _otg-disk_ supports _bash_
command completion.  Since you will not interact with _otg_disk_ on a
daily basis it is not expected that the completion code is added to
the system's configuration.  Instead it can be added on demand with

    $ eval "$(./otg-disk --bc)"

in the shell where you work with _otg-disk_.  You don't have to
remember the command above: it is printed as one of the last lines
from `--help`.


### Displaying, changing and saving configuration

_otg-disk_ does not use a configuration file.  All configuration is
set with shell environment variables at the top of the script.  This
is unusual but has an interesting effect, which is important for me:
it's all in one file.  Effectively you can use any text editor to view
or change _otg-disk_'s configuration.  Or you can use its command line
interface.

`./otg-disk --show-config` displays the effective configuration values
as they are used after evironment variables have been substituted.
With no further arguments all values are listed.  Any argument is
interpreted as regular expression which is tested againt the option
names and matching names are printed.  All matching is done in
lowercase.  The important thing to remember is that if you provide a
common part of a set of option names all options aare listed as in

    $ ./otg-disk --show-config ap

Regular expressions are nice but only for sophisticated things.

The `--configure` operation sets configuration options.  It expects
sequences of combinations of names and values on the command line and
edits the corresponding variables inside the script.  (The
_otg-script_ modifies itself.) Configuration names

 - must be preceded with two dashes `--`,
 - may be given in lowercase characters with dashes instead of
   underscores.

For example,

    $ ./otg-disk --configure --public-share-name public \
        --public-share-path '$HOME/tmp/otg-disk'

would set the variable `PUBLIC_SHARE_NAME` to `public` surrounding the
value with double quotes:

    PUBLIC_SHARE_NAME="public"
    PUBLIC_SHARE_PATH="$HOME/tmp/otg-disk"


The `--configure` operation has some more uses.  It can also print
configuration values - but only the values:

    ./otg-disk --configure --print AP_IFC AP_IP_ADDR
    wlan0
    192.168.1.1

This may be used to query options from other scripts.

Finally, `--configure` can be used to save configuration in a file,
more precise: a shell script.

    ./otg-disk --configure --export private_

prints

```
    #!/bin/sh
    #

    ./otg-disk --configure \
        --private-share-name '' \
        --private-share-path '/home/$USER/tmp/otg-disk' \
        --private-share-username '$USER' \
        --private-share-password 'PutYourPasswordHere' \
        --private-share-opt ''
```

which can be stored in a file to later reset these values.
`--show-config --shell ...` is similar but does not retain environment
variables inside the option values.


### Installing additional software

_otg-disk_ contains all additional scripts and configuration but it
needs some software packages from the operating system.  They must be
installed first.  This can be done manually (see end of this document)
but it's simple for the basic packages.

    $ ./otg-disk --sys-config

displays the commands, which are required to install all missing
packages and to create configured directories.  You can copy-paste
selected commands to the shell or - after checking - run

    $ ./otg-disk --sys-config | sh -x


### Starting otg-disk

When you have installed required additional packages and configured
your system you can run _otg-disk_ with

    $ ./otg-disk --start

The server runs in foreground until it is terminated with `Ctrl+C` and
log messages are printed to the terminal so the process should not be
backgrounded.  If you want to run _otg-disk_'s operations you must
open another console and make sure to invoke the same copy of the
script.

See the [next document][2] to read how _otg-disk_ is installed as
system service.


### Manual installation of additional packages

Just in case you do not want `--sys-config` to install additional
software, here are the instructions for manual work.

_otg-disk_'s core function is to run a _samba_ file server.  The
required packages are

 - _samba_ for the file server, and
 - _inotify-tools_ to monitor file deletions.

If you are not sure what packages you might need install, run

    $ ./otg-disk --apt-check

This lists the packages you already have and those, which are
missing.  In case the two above mentioned pckages are missing you could
install them with

    $ sudo apt update  &&  sudo apt install samba inotify-tools
    $ sudo systemctl stop smbd nmbd
    $ sudo systemctl disable nmbd smbd

This installs the software but disables the services to start during
system boot because we want them on demand from _otg-disk_.

A shortcut for the install-stop-disable commands above is

    $ sudo ./otg-disk --apt-get samba inotify-tools - smbd nmbd

You still have to run `sudo apt-get update` before to update the
repository information.

In case you have already a running _samba_ server, there is nothing
to do.  _otg-disk_ will stop the services _smbd_ and _nmbd_ and
restart them when it terminates.  Also the service configuration is
only local and will not interfere with yours.

The document descibing the [easy mode][1] lists instructions to
install the other packages manually, if you want them.
