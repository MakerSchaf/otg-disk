<P>Such user account are not intended to implement a full user management
you would expect on a regular file server but are meant to be shared
among the persons which are allowed to access the share to give a
share-level access control.</P>

<!-- source: text/markdown

 This document describes _otg-disk_'s user interface (command line
 only), the configuration options and command line operations.


# otg-disk Reference

## User Interface

_otg-disk_ is controlled and configured with command line options.
(Configuration is also possible by editing the script, which is
equivalent to command line options.)  To make things easier _bash_
completion is supported.  The `--bc` option lists the shell code
needed for it.

Activate it on-demand by runnning

    $ eval "$(./otg-disk --bc)"

or save the output to a file and move it to _/etc/bash_completion.d_.

    $ ./otg-disk --bc bc.otg-disk
    $ sudo mv bc.otg-disk /etc/bash_completion.d

Relogin (or reboot) to activate it.

Use `./otg-disk --help` to get a brief overview about the
implemented commands.


## Configuration options

_otg-disk_ uses shell variables for its configuration, which can be
changed within the script or with the **--configure** option.

``` _
    $ ./otg-disk --show-config \[_regex_ ...\]
```

lists the current configuration.  If _regex_ is present only
variables names that match one of the regular expressions are listed.


### General options

 : **LOGDIR** = _directory_
  the directory where _otg-disk_ write its logfiles when running as a
  service.  (When running from a console, logfiles are printed there).
  If `$LOGDIR` is not set any output goes to the system's logfile.

 : **OTG_DEV_ADDR** = _mac_
  _otg-disk_ can load the OTG g_ether module if the _dwc2_ overlay
  is activated in _/boot/config.txt_, the module is not already
  loaded and there is only one USB device (the Raspberry's own USB
  hub) is found and the USB MAC address is set with this option.

 : **OTG_FAILSAFE** = yes | no
  If things turn really bad _otg-disk_ can send your Raspberry into a
  boot loop.  (It reboots when the respective file is deleted with no
  further questions asked.)  Setting this options to `yes` disables
  the systemd service for future boots.  The `--enable` reenables the
  service.

 : **OTG_STOP_FILE** = yes | no
  If `yes` then the file _otg-disk.stop_ is created in $SYSCTRL
  and deleting the file stops _otg-disk_.

 : **SYSCTRL** = _directory_
  _otg-disk_ provides service control by accessing files in a certain
  directory, which is set with this option and must be inside one of
  the configured samba shares.

 : **SERVICE_LIST** = _services_
  define the services for which _otg-disk_ provides control files.
  This list must contains those services which cannot be detected by
  _otg-disk_.

 : **SYSTEM_SERVICES** = _services_
  _otg-disk_ tests and stops these system services on startup to
  avoid conflicts.  Stopped services are restarted when _otg-disk_
  terminates.
  
 : **START_SERVICES** = _services_
  These services are automatically started when _otg-disk_ starts.

 : **USER** = _username_
  this option configures the system user for _otg-disk_ when running
  as system service.


### Samba shares

The public samba share is a core function of _otg-disk_.  It is
configured with two options only:

 : **PUBLIC_SHARE_NAME** = _name_
  the public share name.

 : **PUBLIC_SHARE_PATH** = _directory_
  the directory of the public share.

 : **PUBLIC_SHARE_OPT** = _smb.conf-options_
  additional configuration options to the public share definition.

The share is created if its name and path is configured.  The
directory is created if it doesn't exist and permissions are changed
to allow public access to guest users (no login must be provided)
and operations are done with `$USER` permissions.  With

    PUBLIC_SHARE_OPT="read only = yes"

the share is not writeable.


Optionally, _otg-disk_ can create a private share from the following
options:

 : **PRIVATE_SHARE_NAME** = _name_
  the name of the private samba share.

 : **PRIVATE_SHARE_PATH** = _directory_
  the directory of the private samba share.

 : **PRIVATE_SHARE_USERNAME** = _username_
  username to access the private samba share, the default is the
  configured username.

 : **PRIVATE_SHARE_PASSWORD** = _password_
  password to access the private samba share.

 : **PRIVATE_SHARE_OPT** = _smb.conf-options_
  additional configuration options to the private share definition.

Name and path must be set to get the share The configured directory is
created if it does not exist.  The password must be set too to access
the share.  Additional options are taken from the `$PRIVATE_SHARE_OPT`
variable which must be a list of colon-separated share options.


_otg-disk_ can construct more samba shares from the following
option.

 : **OTHER_SHARES** = _share-definitions_
  a list of semicolon-separated share definition and each share
  definition is a list of colon-separated share options of the form
  `option = value`.  The first two options without a `=` define the
  share's name and path.

The given options are combined with the defaults

    browseable = yes
    guest ok = no
    read only = no
    create mask = 644
    directory mask = 775

to define the share.  The user's _samba_ password may follow the
username in the `valid users` option separated with a slash `/` from
the account name.

    mp3:$HOME/music: guest ok = yes: read only: yes;
    documents:$HOME/documents: valid users = $USER, docs/9772

creates the public read-only share _mp3_ and documents which can be
accessed by $USER and _docs_ with `9772` as simple share "password".

Such user account are not intended to implement a full user management
you would expect on a regular file server but are meant to be shared
among the persons which are allowed to access the share to give a
share-level access control.

Furthermore, these accounts need an entry in the system's
_/etc/passwd_ too and can be created with the `--create-share-account`
operation.

    $ sudo ./otg-disk --create-share-account media /home/pi/media

creates a system account with the given home directory.  No password
is set and the login shell is _/bin/true_, that is: the account
cannot be used for system logins.

If a share definition name starts with an `@` _otg-disk_ looks up
the share name in _/etc/passwd_ and uses the home directory as share
path.  For example,

    OTHER_SHARES="@media:valid users = media/9772"

creates the share _media_ and would set _/home/pi/media_ (from the
example above) as path.


The samba configuration file is re-created from the definitions
every time _otg-disk_ starts.  Use

    $ ./otg-disk --smb.conf

to list the effective configuration plus any user accounts created
from it.


### DLNA server

If installed, _otg-disk_ starts _minidlnad_.  A prerequisite is
that the directory to the media files is set.  The directory is
created if it does not exits.

 : **MEDIA_PATH** = _directory_
  set the path to media files for a DLNA server.

However,_otg-disk_ will start the service only if it is not only
running (as system service).  To stop a running _minidlnad_ instance
when _otg-disk_ starts, add `minidlnad` to the `SYSTEM_SERVICES`
variable.


### Builtin HTTP server

The preconfigured HTTP server (_busybox_ http module) use these
configuration options.

 : **HTTP_DOCUMENT_ROOT** = _directory_
  the server's document root directory.

 : **HTTP_PORT** = _int_
  the server's TCP service port.  The server is _not_ started as
  _root_ and this port must be unprivileged (i.e. = 1024).

Both options must be defined to run the server.


### W-Lan and access points

_otg-disk_ can run its own wireless network if _hostapd_ and
_dnsmasq_ are installed.  The network is configured by the following
two sets of options.

 : **WLAN_COUNTRY_CODE** = _code_
  a valid country code, e.g. `DE` for Germany.  With a wrong code
  the access point may not operate (and be illegal).  Use the
  `country` value from `sudo cat
  /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`

 : **WLAN_SSID** = _name_
  the W-Lan network name.

 : **WLAN_PASSWD** = _password_
  the W-Lan password.

The IP-network must be configured too:

 : **AP_IFC** = _wlan-interface_
  the W-Lan adapter; ` wlan0` is usually the right option until
  there are multiple W-Lan adapters.

 : **AP_IP_ADDR** = _ip_
  the device's IP address.

 : **AP_IP_NETWORK** = _network-address_
  the W-Lan's network address.

 : **AP_NETMASK** = _netmask_
  the W-Lan's network mask.

 : **AP_DHCP_DEF** = _dnsmasq-option_
  value to _dnsmasq_'s `-F` option to run a DHCP server.

The parameters above must fit to each other.  _otg-disk_ does not
check for errors.


_otg-disk_ requires a working network connection and can be
configured to start it hotspot if no other network is found.

 : **AP_AUTOSTART** = yes|no
  controls if the access point should be started (= `yes`) or not.

 : **AP_AUTOSTART_DELAY** = _num_
  _otg-disk_ wait for this amount of seconds before network
  connections are tested to give any network enough time to go
  online.

 : **AP_AUTOSTART_HTTP** = yes|no
  defines if _otg-disk_'s HTTP server should be started with the
  automatic access point.  This supports (outdoor) scenarios when
  operating _otg-disk_ from a mobile phone with a web (instead of
  samba) client.

The access point is only started if no active network connection is
found, which includes

 - any W-Lan network,
 - ethernet, and
 - OTG USB network.


### Internal options

The are some more variables available but they are not meant to be
changed.

 : **DIR_PERM** = _perm_
  set the permissions for samba share directories; default is `775`.

 : **MYPID_FILE** = _fn_
  name of _otg-disk_'s pidfile.

 : **RUN** = _directory_
  set the directory for _otg-disk_'s runtime files.  The default is
  _/run/otg-disk_.

 : **SMB_CONF** = _fn_
  name of _smbd_'s configuration file.

 : **SMB_LOG** = _fn_
  name of _smbd_'s logfile.


## Operation Commands

### Installation

The following operations require that superuser permissions are
already set, e.g. using _sudo_.

 : **--apt-get** _pkg_ ... - _service_
  call _apt-get_ to install the listed software packages and
  stop the services.

 : **--apt-system-update**
  convenience function: run _apt-get_ to update all installed
  packages.

 : **--create-share-account** _user_ _dir_
  create the system account _user_ with home directory _dir_ and no
  login shell (set to _/bin/true_) to be used as samba share
  account.

 : **--install**
  create a service unit to install _otg-disk_ as _systemd_
  service.  The script will start automatically when the system
  boots but not when installed.

 : **--install-otg**
  like `--install` but the service will start only if on-the-go
  USB network is found on startup.

 : **--uninstall**
  stop a running _otg-disk_ service and removes the unit file.


### Configuration

 : **--configure** --*var* *val* ...
  Modify the configuration variable(s) *var* in the _otg-disk_ script.
  The changes between old and new script is displayed and the user
  is asked for a confirmation of the changes.  The `--configure` has
  some variations:

   - `--names` lists the variable names as options,
   - ``--print _var_ ...`` prints values of the given variables (on
     per line), and
   - `--help` displays usage information.

 : **--mkdirs**
  Display commands to create missing directories for samba, httpd and
  dlna server.

 : **--show-config** \[_regex_ ...\]
  Print _otg-disk_'s configuration.  If one or more _regex_ is
  present than only variables matching any of _regex_ (case
  ignored) are shown.

 : **--smb.conf**
  Print the computed _smbd_ configuration file.

 : **--sys-config**
  Display shell commands to adjust the Raspberry configuration for
  _otg-disk_'s basic functionality.


### Operation

The operational commands below can be run as normal user and acquire
superuser privileges (_sudo_) as required.  None of the options
below (with the exception of disable/enable) change something on
your system.  Such operations are listed above in the Installation
section (even if they are not fully related to installing something)
and require explicit superuser permissions.

 : **--disable**
  Disable (but don't stop) the _otg-disk_ system service.

 : **--enable**
  Re-enable the service to start on system boot.

 : **--help**
  Show the list of operations.

 : **--logfile**
  Print the name of _otg-disk_'s logfile.

 : **--mount** \[_disk_ _partition_ _uuid_\]
  List all USB disks that were mounted by _otg-disk_.
  A matching partition will be mounted if the parameters are present
  but this operation is called internally from _otg-disk_'s USB
  monitor and not part of the user interface.

 : **--op** _service_ _operation_
  Runs _service_'s action for _operation_.  This is an internal
  operation and is not part of the user interface.  Instead the
  corresponding file ``$SYSCTRL/_service_._operation_`` should be
  removed to trigger the action.

 : **--ps** \[_name_\]
  List _otg-disk_'s processes.  If _name_ is present the process ids
  of _otg-disk_'s process _name_ is returned.

 : **--reopen-log**
  Open a new logfile.

 : **--restart**
  Restart the service.

 : **--scan-files**
  List extension files found in _otg-disk_'s directory.

 : **--start**
  Start _otg-disk_.

 : **--status**
  Check if _otg-disk_'s is running.

 : **--stop**
  Stop _otg-disk_.

 : **--tail**
  Follow _otg-disk_'s logfile.

 : **--tcp** \[_port_\]
  List processes with TCP service ports.  If _port_ is present the
  pid of the service listening on _port_ is returned.  `--tcp` will
  not list _smbd_ (ot other services that are started from
  _otg-disk_ with a different user).  Process names are not as well
  computed an in `--ps`.

 : **--umount** _uuid_
  Unmount the partition _uuid_ which must have been mounted by
  _otg-disk_.

 : **--version**
  Print _otg-disk_'s version.

 : **--wlan**
  Print the W-Lan status.

Use **--help** to get a brief overview about the operations.
